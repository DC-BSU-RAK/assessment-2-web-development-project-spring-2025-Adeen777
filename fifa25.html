        EA Sports FC 25 offers a series of new features and improvements to enhance realism, strategy, and variety in its game and modes. FC IQ has rewritten gameplay entirely, with enhanced dynamic team plans and cunning AI that allows players to replicate strategies of actual games and develop in the midst of games. Player roles have been reworked to best fit individual abilities, and goalkeepers are supported by enhanced PlayStyles and influence mechanisms. There's a new "professional foul" mode that introduces strategy by way of tactical fouling via penalties. The game replaces VOLTA out with 5v5 Rush Mode, a faster small-sided mode which can be found in a variety of modes including Ultimate Team and Career. Career Mode also has "Career Live Start Points," where players can start in genuine league positions at mid-season, and the very first fully authentic women's career mode in leading leagues. Ultimate Team has also been enhanced with additional Evolution slots, a new Overall Rating (OVR) search filter, and refreshed starter packs. Presentation enhancements include expanded licensing to more than 30 leagues and 19,000 players, and new commentary teams in specific regions. Overall, all of these features are designed to give all players a more immersive, richer football experience.
